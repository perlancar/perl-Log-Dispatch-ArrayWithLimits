0.03    2014-07-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Bugfix] max_elems didn't work because I forgot to set object
          attribute. Double derp.

        - Use repeated shift() instead of splice() to support
          threads::shared-array.


0.02    2014-07-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Bugfix] Typo. First version didn't work, derp.

        - Allow specifying array variable name (e.g. 'My::array' instead of
          \@My::Array). This makes it possible to use this module from Log4perl
          configuration, which is a text file.


0.01    2014-07-06 (SHARYANTO)
